![Desktop screenshot]({{ "/assets/img/primequery-desktop.jpg" | absolute_url }})
A lecture assistant web app allowing students to ask questions in
real time while upvoting other questions they think are relevant.

## Background
This was a project I worked on with three other students at a hackathon hosted at
Cornell University.
